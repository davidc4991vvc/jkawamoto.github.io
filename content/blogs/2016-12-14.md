## Summary
[watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) supports incremental build to reduce building time,
and [gulp-watchify](https://github.com/marcello3d/gulp-watchify) is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin of watchify.
This post explains how to apply watchfy to [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Parcelify](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/parcelify)
with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).


## gulp-watchify
From a [sample file](https://github.com/marcello3d/gulp-watchify/blob/master/examples/simple/gulpfile.js),
basic usage is

```coffeescript
gulp = require "gulp"
$ = require("gulp-load-plugins")()
watching = false

gulp.task "browserify", $.watchify (watchify) ->
  gulp.src "src/*.js"
    .pipe watchify
      watch:watching
    .pipe gulp.dest "public/js/"

gulp.task "watch", ->
  watching = true
```

By this task file, `gulp browserify` builds normally,
and `gulp watch browserify` starts watching script files to incremental build.

Note that installing gulp-watchify doesn't install watchify, and you need to run

```bash
$ npm i â€”save-dev watchify gulp-watchify
```


## Use parcelify
gulp-watchify takes callback functions which will be called before bundling.
We use parcelify in the callback function.

```coffeescript
gulp = require "gulp"
parcelify = require "parcelify"
$ = require("gulp-load-plugins")()
watching = false

gulp.task "browserify", $.watchify (watchify) ->
  gulp.src "src/main.js"
    .pipe watchify
      extensions: [".js"]
      watch: watching
      setup: (bundle) ->
        parcelify bundle,
          bundles:
            style: "public/css/bundle.css"
    .pipe $.rename "bundle.js"
    .pipe gulp.dest "public/js/"

gulp.task "watch", ->
  watching = true
```

This task file reads `main.js` as the entry script and outputs `bundle.js`.
To rename file names, it requires `gulp-rename`, too.

watchify takes same options as ones browserify takes.
The above example takes `extensions`.
