## Summary
[angular-fullpage.js](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js) is a library
to use [fullPage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/),
but the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-fullpage.js) version has a problem in event handling,
and you need to use GitHub version.

Although fullPage.js also assumes every section is a child of a same parent node, it is difficult in AngularJS.
I [modified fullPage.js](https://github.com/jkawamoto/fullPage.js) to solve this problem.

This entry explains how to use my fullPage.js in AngularJS.

## angular-fullpage.js
The current version of angular-fullpage.js in npm has a problem in event handling,
and you need to use the newest source code from GitHub.
`dependencies` in `package.json` allows GitHub repositores, i.e.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "angular-fullpage.js": "hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

and `npm install` downloads the newest source code from GitHub.

To activate fullPage.js, you need to add `full-page` attribute to the parent node

```html
<div full-page>
  <div class="section">Section 1</div>
  <div class="section">Section 2</div>
  <div class="section">Section 3</div>
  â€¦
</div>
```

and give options through `options` attribute.
For example, make a controller

```js
class FullpageCtrl {

  constructor() {

    this.options = {
      sectionsColor: ['#1bbc9b', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE'],
      scrollingSpeed: 1000,
      onLeave: (index, nextIndex, direction) => {
        // do something
      }
    };

  }

}
```

and use it from a template

```html
<div full-page options="$ctrl.options">
  <div class="section">Section 1</div>
  <div class="section">Section 2</div>
  <div class="section">Section 3</div>
  ...
</div>
```


## Apply fullPage.js for not sibling nodes
fullpage.js assumes every section is a child of a same parent node, for example

```html
<div full-page>
  <div class="section">Section 1</div>
  <div class="section">Section 2</div>
  <div class="section">Section 3</div>
  ...
</div>
```

This constraint might be a problem when you combine components providing sections.
Suppose two components `component1` and `component2`, and those templates are

```html
<div class="section" ng-repeat="item in $ctrl.items">
  <!-- some contents -->
</div>
```

```html
<div class="section" ng-repeat="item in $ctrl.items">
  <!-- some contents -->
</div>
```

In this case, a parent node of fullpage.js is

```html
<div full-page>
  <component1></component1>
  <component2></component2>
</div>
```

This template is extended to

```html
<div full-page>
  <component1>
    <div class="section">
     <!-- some contents -->
    </div>
    <div class="section">
     <!-- some contents -->
    </div>
    ...
  </component1>
  <component2>
    <div class="section">
      <!-- some contents -->
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <!-- some contents -->
    </div>
    ...
  </component2>
</div>
```
and those sections are not children of a same parent node,
which means fullPage.js doesn't work in such case.

I fixed this problem and my source code is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/jkawamoto/fullPage.js).
To use my version, your `package.json` should have a link to my repository like

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "fullpage.js": "jkawamoto/fullPage.js#deeper-section-spike",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

This version searches all nodes to find sections and it might be slower than original version.
