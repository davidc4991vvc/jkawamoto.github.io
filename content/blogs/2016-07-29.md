## Summary
[numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) provides an easy optimization for python codes
but `pip` doesn't work to install numba.
This entry explains installation and import way of numba.


## Installation
numba requires [`llvm`](http://llvm.org/) and `enum34`,
and the required version of llvm isn't the newest version 3.8.x but version 3.7.x.
To install such version, you need to tap `homebrew/versions` and set environ variable `LLVM_CONFIG`.
The following steps do that.

```sh
$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew install homebrew/versions/llvm37
$ export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm37/3.7.1/bin/llvm-config-3.7

$ pip install enum34
$ pip install numba
```


## Import numba
We should prepare import even if our source code will run without numba,
and we replace no-op decorate if numba cannot be imported.
The following source code do that:

```py
try:
    from numba import jit
except ImportError:
    def jit(*args, **_kwargs):
        if len(args) > 0 and hasattr(args[0], "__call__"):
            return args[0]
        else:
            def _(func):
                return func
            return _
```

If your code has other decorators than `@jit`, you need to define those decorators,
and in this case, you need to give types as texts not objects.
