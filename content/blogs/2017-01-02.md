## Summary
In order to obtain log data from [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/),
using the [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) client which
[logadmin](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/logging/logadmin) package provides
is one of the easiest ways.
But, the type of log entries returned by the client is
[logging.Entry](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/logging#Entry),
and the type of payloads is `interface{}`, which means you need to cast payloads to access their fields.
This article introduces how to cast them with a pre-defined structure.


## logadmin package
[logadmin](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/logging/logadmin) provides interfaces to access logs
in [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

The following code obtains log entries matching a query in variable `filter`:

```go
import (
    "cloud.google.com/go/logging/logadmin"
    "golang.org/x/net/context"
    "google.golang.org/api/iterator"
)

func GetLogEntries(filter string) error{
    ctx := context.Background()
    client, err := logadmin.NewClient(ctx, "your-project-id")
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer client.Close()

    iter := client.Entries(ctx, logadmin.Filter(filter))
    for {
        e, err := iter.Next()
        if err == iterator.Done {
            return nil
        } else if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        // Use log entry `e`, of which type is logging.Entry.
    }
}
```

## logging.Entry
The type of log entries which the logadmin client returns is
[logging.Entry](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/logging#Entry),
and the type of their payload is `interface{}`.
To access each field of those payloads, you need to case them.
In most cases, you can cast those payloads to pointers of
[`structpb.Struct`](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes/struct#Struct).
Since `structpb.Struct` is a kind of meta-structure,
you also need to convert an instance of `structpb.Struct` to another structure.

My [`structpbconv`](https://github.com/jkawamoto/structpbconv) package
provides such conversion.

## structpbconv
The following code converts a log payload of a VM instance's activity_log
in [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
from a `structpb.Struct` instance.

```go
import (
    "github.com/golang/protobuf/ptypes/struct"
    "github.com/jkawamoto/structpbconv"
)


type ActivityPayload struct {
    EventTimestampUs string `structpb:"event_timestamp_us"`
    EventType        string `structpb:"event_type"`
    TraceID          string `structpb:"trace_id"`
    Actor            struct {
        User string
    }
    Resource struct {
        Zone string
        Type string
        ID   string
        Name string
    }
    Version      string
    EventSubtype string `structpb:"event_subtype"`
    Operation    struct {
        Zone string
        Type string
        ID   string
        Name string
    }
}

func NewActivityPayload(payload *structpb.Struct) *ActivityPayload {
    var res ActivityPayload
    structpbconv.Convert(payload, &res)
    return &res
}
```

I defined `ActivityPayload` structure according to an actual payload of activity_log.
To give a mapping of field names, use a `structpb` tag.


Finally, we can access each field like that:

```go
// Getting log entries of which event types are GCE_OPERATION_DONE.
iter := client.Entries(
  ctx, logadmin.Filter("jsonPayload.event_type = \"GCE_OPERATION_DONE\""))
for {
    e, err := iter.Next()
    if err == iterator.Done {
        return nil
    } else if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Converting the payload.
    if s, ok := e.Payload.(*structpb.Struct); ok {
        payload := NewActivityPayload(s)

        // Printing trace_id.
        fmt.Println(payload.TraceID)
    }

}
```
