## Summary
This document explains how to include packages hosted in GitHub
but not not registered in [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) into `requirements.txt`,
and how to configure `setup.py` referring `requirements.txt`.


## requirements.txt
Supposing https://github.com/rgmining/common as the GitHub repository to be added to `requirements.txt`,
the package information for the repository is

```requirements.txt
-e git+https://github.com/rgmining/common.git#egg=rgmining_common-0.9.0
```

The format after `#egg=` shoule be `<package name>-<version>`.
If you're using `pip-tools` to compile `requirements.txt`,
your `requirements.in` should have the same clause.


## setup.py
To include `requirements.txt` in `setup.py`,
give the following `load_requires_from_file` function to `install_requires` attribute:

```setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

def load_requires_from_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath) as fp:
        return [pkg_name.strip() for pkg_name in fp.readlines()]

setup(
    # Other clauses are omitted.
    install_requires=load_requires_from_file("requirements.txt")
)
```

If your `requirements.txt` has URLs,
`load_requires_from_file` function should be the following:

```setup.py
def take_package_name(name):
    if name.startswith("-e"):
        return name[name.find("=")+1:name.rfind("-")]
    else:
        return name.strip()

def load_requires_from_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath) as fp:
        return [take_package_name(pkg_name) for pkg_name in fp.readlines()]
```

and give those URLs via `dependency_link` attribute in `setup` function:

```setup.py
def load_links_from_file(filepath):
    res = []
    with open(filepath) as fp:
        for pkg_name in fp.readlines():
            if pkg_name.startswith("-e"):
                res.append(pkg_name.split(" ")[1])
    return res

setup(
    # Other clauses are omitted.
    install_requires=load_requires_from_file("requirements.txt"),
    dependency_links=load_links_from_file("requirements.txt"),
)
```

Finally, `python setup.py test` downloads packages from GitHub and runs tests.
